This is a Jekyll static site for an art gallery. Please generate code and content that is modern, beautiful, and user-friendly, with a dark gray gradient background and white text (except navigation). Automate gallery page creation for each category (folder) and display images in a responsive grid. The landing page should link to each category with a thumbnail and label, and fade between images at random intervals (20-40s) with smooth transitions. The site title should be 'Home'.
